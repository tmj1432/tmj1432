### Capstone Project: Human-Emotion-Recognition

### :school:[GA Projects](https://github.com/tmj1432/GA-Projects):school:
This repository consists of projects I completed during my time as a student in General Assembly!

:seedling:**`Project 1`:seedling:: Data Analysis of SAT and ACT**

This was where I first learnt how to use libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. I remembered it to be really difficult while I was doing this project. Looking back, I am proud to see how far I have came... 

:herb:**`Project 2`:herb:: Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa**

This project exposed me to the world of Machine Learning and this was also where ðŸ’— I fell in love with data science ðŸ’— In this project, we were tasked to build a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa.

:potted_plant:**`Project 3`ðŸª´: Web APIs & Natural Language Processing**

In this project, we scraped about 3000 posts from 2 different subreddits with Pushshift's API and built a classifier that can classify which subreddit a certain post came from. Working as a team, we chose to scrape posts from the Depression subreddit as well as Anxiety subreddit and built a classifier that had a 90% precision.    

:deciduous_tree:**`Project 4`:deciduous_tree::Predicting West Nile Virus**

For this project, we were grouped into teams of four. This was where I became more comfortable with solving data science problems and at the same time, I was also exposed to collaborating with four other teammates on the same repository.
