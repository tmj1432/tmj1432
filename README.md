- [DVD Rental Store Analysis](https://github.com/tmj1432/DVD-Rental-Store-Analysis)

  - Conducted analysis of DVD rental store database, writing PostgreSQL queries within Jupyter environment and visualised query outputs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Identified opportunities and provided actionable insights to improve inventory and pricing strategies.


- [HDB Resale Price Predictor Application](https://github.com/tmj1432/HDB-Resale-Price-Predictor-Application)

  - Built and [deployed a predictive model on streamlit.io](https://tmj1432-hdb-resale-price-predictor-application-app-5kd0gz.streamlit.app/) framework for easy access by relevant stakeholders in mind.
  - Achieved a test RMSE of approximately $39600 using XGBoost, which outperformed LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, and ensemble modelling methods.
  - Utilized permutation importance analysis on the final model and identified the top 5 features that significantly influence the modelâ€™s performance and HDB resale price. 
  - Proposed future work includes automating the process with an ML pipeline that extracts data from data.gov's HDB resale price API and updates the model accordingly.

- [Death Row Last Statement Topic Modeling](https://github.com/tmj1432/Death-Row-Last-Statement-Topic-Modeling)
  - Utilized BeautifulSoup to scrape and collect data from 475 inmatesâ€™ last statements.
  - Conducted a data analysis on the last statements of Death Row inmates, where I utilized natural language processing libraries like NLTK to preprocess the data before conducting topic modelling.
  - Explored various clustering techniques with BERTopic to identify distinct topics within the last statements and successfully discovered 5 distinct topics.
 
- [Capstone Project: Human Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/tmj1432/Human-Emotion-Recognition)
  - Project aims to minimise revenue loss through poor customer experiences by building a facial emotion recognition model that detects when a customer is feeling angry, allowing for prompt service recovery and preventing negative customer reviews.
  - Personally collected and carefully curated a dataset comprising approximately 700 images of myself, featuring 4 distinct facial expressions. The objective of this dataset is to train a multi-label classifier with high recall for classifying my own angry facial expressions.
  - Applied haar cascade face detection to identify and isolate faces in the images, and utilized OpenCV to crop the faces for noise reduction.
  - Performed image augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
  - Constructed a 2-layer CNN model using TensorFlow, incorporating regularization techniques, KerasTuner, and three callbacks to enhance model performance and generalizability.
  - Achieved a recall score of 100% for angry faces on the final model iteration.

- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tmj1432/credit-card-fraud-detection-smote-ensemble-model)
  - Employed SMOTE to balance the class distribution and then fine-tuned the models to minimize the precision-recall tradeoff.
  - Constructed an ensemble model by combining KNN and RandomForestClassifier via soft voting, and adjusted the weights to improve performance. This approach outperformed using a single model alone.

- [Forecasting Book Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tmj1432/tabular-playground-series-sep-2022)
  - Transformed a time series forecasting into a supervised learning problem and achieved an RMSE of 15, demonstrating expertise in data preprocessing and machine learning techniques.
  - Designed and developed a [dashboard on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tan.ming.jie/viz/DashboardofKaggleBookstoreSales/BookSales) to monitor book sales, showcasing data visualization and dashboard creation skills, as well as an ability to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders.
  - Proposed 3 recommendations to increase revenue based on the exploratory data analysis.
- [GA Projects](https://github.com/tmj1432/GA-Projects)
  - Project 1: Data Analysis of SAT and ACT
  - Project 2: Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa
  - Project 3: Web APIs & Natural Language Processing
  - Project 4: Predicting West Nile Virus
